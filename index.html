                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>I have always been passionate about technology, not just for its innovation but for its potential to empower people. Accessibility is central to this belief, as I strive to ensure that everyone, regardless of their technical expertise, can utilize their devices to their fullest potential. This passion is not just about providing solutions, but about making technology intuitive, approachable, and usable for all. I believe that true innovation in technology is measured by how easily it can be accessed and understood by diverse populations. Whether it’s helping a friend troubleshoot a system or recommending accessible software to a colleague, I am committed to breaking down the barriers that technology can sometimes create.</p>

                <div class="box-content">
                    <p>I am deeply connected to the environment, and this connection shapes many of my decisions, both personal and professional. I am not only a lover of nature but also an advocate for sustainability. In my own backyard, I tend to a personal garden that reflects this passion, with my favorite being a mulberry tree, which symbolizes growth, resilience, and a nurturing approach to nature. This love for the environment drives me to seek out eco-friendly practices in technology as well, from energy-efficient devices to software that minimizes resource consumption. I believe that advancing technology should coexist harmoniously with protecting our planet, and I actively seek to contribute to both.</p>

                    <p>Inclusion and diversity are not just values I believe in; they are principles I live by. I am committed to fostering environments where people of all backgrounds and experiences feel valued and included. To enrich my own understanding and ensure that I grow in diversity, I frequently partner with and surround myself with individuals from a wide array of cultural backgrounds—whether Russian, Mexican, or from other unique communities. By embracing this diversity, I continuously learn from their perspectives, improving my ability to collaborate, innovate, and lead in a global society. To me, inclusion is about actively creating spaces where everyone, regardless of who they are or where they come from, feels respected and heard.</p>

                    <p>In today’s digital age, privacy is a value I hold close. I believe that everyone should have the right to control their own data and protect their personal information. To ensure this in my own life, I am a strong advocate of open-source solutions and privacy-centric tools. On my PC, I use Linux paired with Firefox and DuckDuckGo to minimize my digital footprint. For mobile, I trust Apple’s iPhone due to its proven security measures and commitment to privacy. I take careful steps to ensure my personal data is protected, and I advocate for others to do the same. Privacy is about freedom—freedom from unwanted intrusion, and the freedom to exist online without being constantly monitored.</p>
